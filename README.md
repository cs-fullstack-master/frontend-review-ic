### Problem 1:
Create a button that will console log 0 through 100 when clicked.

### Problem 2:
Create an array with the names Kenn, Kevin, and Erin. Create an h1 that has "Teacher" and a button underneath it with "Click".
Once the button is click, have the h1 element cycle throught the three names.

### Problem 3:
Create a header that goes all the way across the screen, two section areas that are split evenly, and a footer that goes all the way across the screen. <strong>DO NOT COPY THIS FROM YOUR LAST CLASSWORK. RETYPE EVERYTHING</strong>

### Challenge to finish by morning:
Put the word CodeCrew in a div with a blue background and 20% width. Give it a class of flyingCodeCrew. In your javascript, when the key for down is press, make the relative position go down 10px. If the key for up is pressed, make the relative position go up for 10px. Do the same for left and right.

Note: Use document.addEventListener('keydown', [FUNCTION]); when getting all keyboard strikes.
Note2: [ELEMENT].style.[DIRECTION] does not return a value. You have to keep up with it yourself.
